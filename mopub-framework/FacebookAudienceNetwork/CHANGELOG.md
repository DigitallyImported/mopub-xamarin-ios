## Changelog
* 5.2.0.0
    * This version of the adapters has been certified with Facebook Audience Network 5.2.0. 
    * Add `FacebookNativeAdRenderer` to render native ads using [predefined layouts from Facebook Audience Network](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network/ios/nativeadtemplate). You won't need to use a custom layout. Simply pass your `MPStaticNativeAdRendererSettings` to the `FacebookNativeAdRenderer`'s `rendererConfigurationWithRendererSettings:` call, and register that configuration with the ad request.
     * Replace `FBAdChoicesView` with `FBAdOptionsView`.

* 5.1.0.4
    * Adapters now fetch only the core MoPub iOS SDK (excluding viewability SDKs). Publishers wishing to integrate viewability should fetch the `mopub-ios-sdk` dependency in their own Podfile.

* 5.1.0.3
    * Update Adapter Version in FacebookAdapterConfiguration to accommodate podspec changes for Unity releases.
    
* 5.1.0.2
    * Move source_files to the `Network` subspec. 

* 5.1.0.1
    * **Note**: This version is only compatible with the 5.5.0+ release of the MoPub SDK.
    * Add the `FacebookAdapterConfiguration` class to: 
         * pre-initialize the Facebook Audience Netwok SDK during MoPub SDK initialization process
         * store adapter and SDK versions for logging purpose
         * return the Advanced Biding token previously returned by `FacebookAdvancedBidder.m`
    * Streamline adapter logs via `MPLogAdEvent` to make debugging more efficient. For more details, check the [iOS Initialization guide](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/ios/initialization/) and [Writing Custom Events guide](https://developers.mopub.com/docs/ios/custom-events/).

* 4.99.0.0
    * This version of the adapters has been certified with Facebook Audience Network 4.99.0 for all ad formats except native ads.
    * This version of the Audience Network SDK deprecates several existing native ad APIs used in the existing adapters. As a result, the current native ad adapters are not compatible. Updates require changes from the MoPub SDK as well, so we are planning to release new native ad adapters along with our next SDK release. Publishers integrated with Facebook native ads are recommended to use the pre-4.99.0 SDKs until the updates are available.
